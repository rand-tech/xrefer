ARTIFACT_ANALYZER_PROMPT = '''
You will be provided with a JSON object containing artifacts extracted from a binary file. The artifacts are organized by type, where each type maps to a dictionary of artifacts. Each artifact is represented by an `index` and its `content`.

**Input Format:**

```json
{
  "type1": {
    "index1": "artifact1",
    "index2": "artifact2",
    ...
  },
  "type2": {
    "index3": "artifact3",
    "index4": "artifact4",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

**Your Task:**

Analyze the provided artifacts and return a JSON object containing only the indexes of the "interesting" artifacts according to the criteria specified below.

**Output Format:**

Your response must be a pure JSON object with the following structure:

```
{
  "interesting_indexes": [index1, index2, index3, ...]
}
```

The interesting_indexes key maps to an array of integers (indexes) representing the selected "interesting" artifacts.
Do not include any additional text, explanations, or formatting outside of the JSON object.
Ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted and can be parsed without errors.


**Example Input:**

```
{
  "Strings": {
    "1": "Initialization complete.",
    "3": "C:\\sdfsssdf-sdfdssdf\\sfsdfdsdf\\91\\fsdfdf.pdb",
    "6": "/usr/local/lib/libc.so"
  },
  "APIs": {
    "2": "kernel32.dll:CreateFileW",
    "5": "msvcrt.dll:memcpy"
  },
  "CAPA": {
    "4": "Create remote thread in another process",
    "7": "Bind to a socket to receive incoming connections"
  },
  "Libraries": {
    "8": "openssl.dll"
  }
}
```

**Example Output:**

```
{
  "interesting_indexes": [2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

Instructions:

    1) Analyze Each Artifact:
        a) For each type, examine the artifacts in the provided dictionaries.
        b) Use the content to determine if the artifact meets the criteria for being "interesting".

    2) Select "Interesting" Artifacts:
        a) If an artifact is deemed "interesting," include its index in the output array.
        b) Do not include artifacts that do not meet the criteria.

    3) Prepare the Output:
        a) Create a JSON object with the key interesting_indexes.
        b) The value should be an array of integers representing the indexes of the selected artifacts.
        c) Do not include any other keys or data in the JSON.

    4) Ensure Correct JSON Formatting:
        a) The output must be valid JSON.
        b) Do not include extra commas, missing brackets, or any syntax errors.

Remember:

    1) Only include the indexes of artifacts that are "interesting" according to the criteria.
    2) Exclude all artifacts that do not meet the criteria.
    3) Your output should be concise and strictly follow the specified format.
    4) If you are unsure about whether to include or exclude something, then just include it.
    5) Be less restrictive in what you include.


Begin analyzing the artifacts and provide raw JSON output without quotes or code snippets. Do NOT wrap the JSON in code fences or formatting. The input is as follows:
